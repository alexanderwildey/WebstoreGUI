# WebstoreGUI
Simple webstore with GUI 
Created as a course project.

Items to be ordered can be found in the inventory.txt file and added to the cart in the program using the item ID number.
The program allows for 10 unique items to be added to the cart.
A discount is factored into the cost for various quantities of a single item:
  1-4 = 0% discount
  5-9 = 10% discount
  10-14 = 15% discount
  >=15 = 20% discount

Final price is calculated with a tax rate of 6%.
